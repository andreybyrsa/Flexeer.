# Flexeer.
First repository after 2 weeks in frontend learning
# Process
1. Created for myself database with basic info about each artist
2. Every 'click' function call is fixed by counter
3. Counter makes working function without qeual actions (by conditions)
4. Script optimisation: no same elements, clearInterval() for info 'span' (in process)

# Todo 
- [ ] Set up a function call for artist info ('span' with clearInterval/letterTimeout = 0)
- [ ] Set uo second 'click' function call for button 'more'
- [ ] Script + css code for section with class 'sectionMusic' (elements with changing position)
